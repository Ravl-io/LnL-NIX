# Lunch and learn - NIX

### What is NIX?

NIX is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes package management reliable and reproducible. It allows you to create isolated environments for your projects, ensuring that dependencies do not interfere with each other.

NIX is also a powerful tool for managing system configurations, allowing you to define your entire system configuration in a single file. This makes it easy to reproduce your environment on different machines or roll back changes if something goes wrong.

### Why use NIX?

- **Reproducibility**: NIX allows you to create reproducible environments, ensuring that your projects work the same way on different machines.

- **Isolation**: NIX isolates packages in their own environments, preventing conflicts between dependencies and the ability to switch between different versions of packages easily.

- **Rollback**: NIX allows you to roll back changes to your system configuration, making it easy to revert to a previous state if something goes wrong.

- **Declarative configuration**: NIX allows you to define your entire system configuration in a single file, making it easy to reproduce your environment on different machines.

- **Cross-platform**: NIX works on Linux and other Unix systems, making it a versatile tool for developers.

- **Community**: NIX has a large and active community, providing a wealth of resources and support for users.

- **Integration**: NIX integrates well with other tools and languages, making it a powerful addition to your development workflow (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, VSCOde, etc.).

- **Performance**: NIX is designed to be fast and efficient, making it a great choice for developers who need to manage large numbers of packages and dependencies.

- **Security**: NIX provides a secure environment for running applications, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and exploits.

- **Documentation**: NIX has extensive documentation and resources available, making it easy to learn and use.

### NIX in the wild

There are several projects and organizations that use NIX in production and several that have built their entire business on it. One example include [Replit](https://replit.com/), a popular online coding platform that uses NIX to manage its infrastructure and dependencies.

It wouldn't surprise me if Github is useing NIX under the hood as well!
